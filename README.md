## Project description

I plan to train a model that will classify the single cells of a brain dataset by cell type from an Alzheimer's Disease mouse model (5xFAD) or wild-type (WT) model. I already have data processed from GSE208683 which I have used in my research. My plan for this is to select all genes for the cells and use them to predict the cell types/phenotype. Single-cell classification is often difficult and training a model that can classify a cell type is useful. I will try various parameters and architectures to see which performs the best.
