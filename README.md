## Project description

I plan to train a model that will classify the single cells of a brain dataset by cell type and whether or not they are cells from an Alzheimer's Disease mouse model (5xFAD) or wild-type (WT) model. I already have data processed from GSE208683 which I have used in my research. My plan for this is to select the highly variable features of the cells (2000-3000) and use them to predict the cell types/phenotype. Single-cell classification is often difficult and training a model that can classify a cell type is useful. Additionally, I want to see how well a model can discern the 5xFAD cells from WT cells to see which of the cell types might be different or similar across the phenotypes. I will try various parameters and architectures to see which performs the best.
